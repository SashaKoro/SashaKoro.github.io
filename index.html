No biggie, I like it just the same. Wait, I had a point here... oh yes: </p>

		<h1 id="blogHeader">Welcome to my blog!</h1>
		<h3 id="blogDate">November 11, 2016</h3>
		<p>Hello website visitors! Let this be my first blog post. Ever. I’ve decided to create this blog to document my programming journey. I began teaching myself programming on September 20, 2016. So I’m almost two months in at this point and I am having a great time. My only past experience with programming was an intro course back in 2014 when I was attending community college. I had a lot of other things on my mind at the time and as a result, the course made no impression on me whatsoever. Then I moved to Cincinnati on September 7th and I found myself with a strong sense of motivation, I was no longer living with my parents and working in another entry level job was not going to cut it. I wanted a career. I wanted to be intellectually challenged at work and have the opportunity to grow without limits. As I started researching careers I stumbled onto programming, and as I learned more and more about the field, I realized that this is what I was looking for all along. Freely shared knowledge. The ability to work and contribute from anywhere and anytime. An outlet for almost limitless creative expression. A field that eagerly embraces newcomers. A community that wants to better the world. …Oh, and the pay isn’t bad either!</p><br><p>For the first 4 weeks I studied part time as I was still working, but I decided to quit my part time job on October 24th and focus 100% on studying. It was a strategic decision, I was working at a warehouse and the only thing I was earning there was money. I was not learning, I was not growing, I was only getting a paycheck. So the past 3 weeks of studying full time have been excellent. I have managed to put in 54 and 55 hours during the first two ‘full-time’ weeks respectively and this week, I am on track for 60! I never could have imagined myself devoting so much time to one thing and enjoying it so much. With some encouragement I have created my first project, the calculator/frankulator you can find on this website. I had so much fun creating it, that I knew this was the way to learn. Learn by doing, learn by building. And now I have created this website from scratch, a place to document my progress, my blog and my projects. My goal for learning is to continue doing things that I think I cannot do. I did not think I was capable of building the calculator, but I did it. Now my next project will be even more ambitious, I will create a complete end-to-end application and launch it. I want to cover all my bases; the planning, the design, security, accessibility, server stuff, support. I want to cover the things that I do not even know will need to be covered. If I need to learn new technologies in creating this, I will learn them. New tools, I will use them. I’m starting today after I finish writing up this blog and committing this website. I will update and post my progress on this blog and on github.</p><br><p>Oh yeah, If you are in Cincinnati - I will be launching a paired programming meetup in December. There are tons of tech meetups in Cincinnati and they are great, but they are mostly focused on tech presentations and on networking. I want to create a meetup where people are empowered to work side by side on a problem and gain the critical skill of teamwork that is so important for modern programming. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, I am happy to respond and help guide beginners who are also starting their coding journey. Till next time!</p>
